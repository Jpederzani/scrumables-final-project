                <h2>Hot Rocks Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the <q>Roll Dice</q> button at the top of the screen;</li>
                    <li>Each time you roll you <b>need</b> to collect points, which are <q>1s</q>, <q>5s</q>, or any <q>3-of-a-kind</q> group of dice;</li>
                    <li>Collecting points requires those dice be pulled from play and the remaining can be rolled;</li>
                    <li>If you are unable to find any points in a roll, you lose all the points you acquired on that roll;</li>
                    <li>Players must decide when to stop a turn and choose the "Stay" button to add their score to the scoreboard;</li>
                    <li><q>Locked</q> scores are safe and cannot be lost their score in and to the</li>                    
                    <li>Players play to a pre-determined number, usually 5000 points;</li>
                    <li>The first player to reach, exceed, and <q>stay</q> before losing their points, triggers the <b><q>Final Round</q></b>;
                        <li>Every player gets one last turn to roll;</li>
                        <li>If any player exceeds the score of the player who triggered the final round, they become the leader</li>
                        <li>Once all players have attempted their final roll, the player with the highest score wins;</li>
                        <li><i>The player who triggers the final round has that turn counted as their final roll, so the better set the score very high;</i></li></li>
                    <li>If any player rolls a <q>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</q> in any single roll (all six dice at once) you have just rolled <b>HOT ROCKS!</b></li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Special Rules:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>On your first turn you must exceed 600 points before stopping your turn and posting your score;</li>
                    <li>Rolling <b>HOT ROCKS!</b> is worth 2500 points and a new roll.  Don't get greedy though and lose it;</li>
                    <li>Points are assigned based off face value:
                        <i><li>5 = 50 points</li>
                        <li>1 = 100 points</li>
                        <li>3 x 2-6 = n x 100 points  <i>(ex: rolling three <q>2s</q> is 200 pts)</i></li>
                        <li>3 x 1 = 1000 points</li></i></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
